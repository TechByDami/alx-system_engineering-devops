* You must use the case statement

**7. Clock**

     Write a Bash script that displays the time for 12 hours and 59 minutes:

* display hours from 0 to 12
* display minutes from 1 to 59
Requirements:

* You must use the while loop (for and until are forbidden)
  Note that in this example, we only display the first 70 lines using the

     Write a Bash script that gives you information about the holbertonschool file.

Requirements:

* You must use if and, else (case is forbidden)
* Your Bash script should check if the file exists and print:
  * if the file exists: holbertonschool file exists
  * if the file does not exist: holbertonschool file does not exist
* If the file exists, print:
  * if the file is empty: holbertonschool file is empty
  * if the file is no empty: holbertonschool file is not empty
  * if the file is a regular file: holbertonschool is a regular file
  * if the file is not a regular file: (nothing)

**10. FizzBuzz**

      Write a Bash script that displays numbers from 1 to 100.

Requirements:

* Displays FizzBuzz when the number is a multiple of 3 and 5
